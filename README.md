# Diabetes
This code is a Python code for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict diabetes. It starts by loading the diabetes prediction dataset into a pandas DataFrame and performing some exploratory data analysis (EDA). The code then performs some data preprocessing and splits the data into training and test sets.

Next, the code builds and evaluates four different machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The code also builds and evaluates an XGBoost model, which is a type of ensemble learning model.

The results show that the Random Forest model performs the best, with an accuracy of 95%. The XGBoost model also performs well, with an accuracy of 93%. And a Linear Regression model to predict diabetes and evaluates its performance which has an accuracy of 90%.

Overall, this project is used to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict diabetes.
